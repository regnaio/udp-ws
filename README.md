“I feel what is needed is a UDP version of WebSockets. That’s all I wish we had.” - Matheus Valadares, creator of agar.io

udp-ws is built on WebRTC, which allows peer-to-peer UDP communication in the browser. However, udp-ws is for client-server communication (e.g. for server-authoritative browser games), not peer-to-peer communication. udp-ws accomplishes this by treating your server as a peer.

Client example:

Server example:

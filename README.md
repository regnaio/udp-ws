# udp-ws

As quoted in [Gaffer On Games](https://gafferongames.com/post/why_cant_i_send_udp_packets_from_a_browser/),

<em>“I feel what is needed is a UDP version of WebSockets. That’s all I wish we had.”</em> - Matheus Valadares, creator of [agar.io](https://agar.io/)

udp-ws is built on [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), which allows peer-to-peer UDP communication in the browser. However, udp-ws is designed for client-server communication (e.g. for server-authoritative browser games), not for peer-to-peer communication. udp-ws accomplishes this by treating your server as a peer.

Client example:

Server example:
